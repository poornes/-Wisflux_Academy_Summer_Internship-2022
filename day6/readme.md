JavaScript helps us to execute complex actions and also enables the interaction of websites with visitors.

Why do prefer const over var?
If you wish for a variable to be re-definable, one can prefer using var. The usage of const makes sure that the variable binding is immutable but the object itself can change whenever you like.

What are Objects?

Arrays in JS are zero-indexed.
What is a function?
Functions are a set of of organised instructions that correspond to a certain task or specific functionality a user wants to implement in their program to achieve a single desired outcome.

How can we implement call by value and call by reference in Javascript?
Call by Value :- When a variable is passed as a parameter to a function, if any changes are made to the parameter, the original variable will remain unaffected. This is known as call by value and this is true for all values having a primitive data type.

Example :-

let origin = 10;
function updateOriginal(originalVal){
    originalVal +=10;
    console.log(originalVal);
}
updateOriginal(original);
console.log(original);
Call by reference :- When a variable’s reference(address) and not its value is passed to a function’s parameter, any changes made to the parameter will update the original variable reference. This is known as call by reference and this is true for all values having a non-primitive data type.

Example :-

let myObj = {
    value:10
}
function updateValue(objRef){
    objRef.value = 20;
}
updateValue(myobj);
console.log(myObj.value);
What are the primitive data types in Javascript?
There are 7 primitive data types:-

Boolean type
Null type
Undefined type
Number type
BigInt type
String type

What is DOM?
The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

Why do we need DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic. The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes.
